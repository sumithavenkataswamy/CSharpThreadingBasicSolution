### **Process:**
When you launch an application, the operating system assigns a **process** to the application. A process is an isolated container that holds all the resources (memory, handles, etc.) required for the application to run.

### **Thread:**
A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. It handles the actual execution of your code. A single process can have multiple threads running concurrently, allowing it to perform multiple operations at the same time.

---

### **Task:**
A **Task** is an abstraction built on top of threads, provided by the Task Parallel Library (TPL). It simplifies creating, managing, and scheduling concurrent operations. Instead of directly dealing with threads, the `Task` manages how threads are created, executed, and recycled through the **thread pool**. It also supports advanced features like continuations and returning results.

### **Async Programming (Asynchronous Programming):**
**Usage:**
1. It allows tasks to be processed **concurrently**, enabling better responsiveness for applications, especially for I/O-bound operations like file access or network requests.
2. It improves **scalability** by efficiently managing limited threads/resources (e.g., handling multiple requests simultaneously without blocking threads unnecessarily).
3. It enables tasks to run **concurrently** on either a single thread or multiple threads, depending on how the program is designed.

**Key Note:** Until the `await` keyword is encountered in an asynchronous method, the code runs synchronously on the same thread. When `await` is hit, the method may pause execution and free the thread for other work until the awaited task completes.
